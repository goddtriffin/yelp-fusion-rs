## Examples

Search for businesses based on custom criteria!

`YELP_FUSION_API_KEY=<api_key> cargo run --example business_search`

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let yelp_fusion_api_key = env::var("YELP_FUSION_API_KEY").expect("no Yelp Fusion API key");

    let yelp_fusion_client: YelpFusion = YelpFusion::new(yelp_fusion_api_key, None);
    let business_search_payload: BusinessSearchPayload = BusinessSearchPayload::builder()
            .coordinates(Coordinates::new(37.772_484, -122.396_68))
            .radius(1609)
            .categories(vec![String::from("mexican"), String::from("sandwiches")])
            .limit(50)
            .price(HashSet::from([
              PriceType::OneDollar, 
              PriceType::TwoDollar, 
              PriceType::ThreeDollar, 
              PriceType::FourDollar,
            ]))
            .open_now(false)
            .build()
            .unwrap();
    let business_search_response: BusinessSearchResponse = yelp_fusion_client
            .business_search(business_search_payload)
            .await?;
    
    println!(
        "{}",
        serde_json::to_string(&business_search_response).unwrap()
    );
    Ok(())
}
```

## Developers

Project is under active maintenance - even if there are no recent commits!
Please submit an issue / bug request if the library needs updating for any reason!

### Feature Requests

#### Implement the rest of the features: Business, Event, Category endpoints

Currently, I only have a use-case for Yelp Fusion API's Business Search endpoint,
so I haven't prioritized developing the rest of the Business, Event, and Category endpoints.

I fully intend to implement all of those features so that this library can do everything the Yelp Fusion API allows.

If you have a dire need for any of those endpoints, please ping me via an issue on Github and I'll know to prioritize that work.
If you're feeling extra adventurous and/or REALLY need those endpoints implemented, please send a pull request :)

### Commands

- `make lint`
- `make test`
- `make fix`
